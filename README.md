Description:
	RLMTownTools is a plugin for Bukkit, which aims to expand on Towny's plot system
	by allowing groups. A plot group will cause all plots within the group to share
	their properties. For example, when one plot in a group is purchased, all other
	plots in that group will be owned by the same person. If it is put up for sale,
	all other plots will be put for sale as well. This essentially makes multiple
	plots in a group act as one.
